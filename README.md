What is Redis?
Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Server, and it is an open source in-memory key value data structure store. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, list, set and more. Redis comes with different flavours like caching, session management, producer/consumer topic messaging and database.

Why do we use Redis?
Redis is speedy because everything stored in in-memory, so there is no hardware involved init. Redis was written in C language, that is why it is extremely fast.

Install Redis Server:
Step 1: Download the latest Redis zip file from the official git hub location. For me it is redis-2.4.5-win32-win64.zip.
Redis (Windows Download):

Step 2: Extract redis-2.4.5-win32-win64.zip file in your preferred location.

Step 3: It will come with two different folders, one is for 32bit, and another one is 64bit based on your operating system.

Step 4: Goto 64bit there you can find below files.

Step 5: Now open the redis-cli.exe file to redis command line interface.

As this acts as a redis client, as soon as we open this cli, we can see the client connected message in redis server like below.

Now we can say that the redis server and client connected successfully. Now letâ€™s try to pass some messages from the client to the redis server.

As we discussed redis is an in-memory key-value data structure store so that the data in redis represents as key-value pairs.

Inserting/Reading data into redis server:
Inserting data in redis:
